    <abstract>
      <t>DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) defines a framework for applications
      to announce and discover services. This includes service names, service
      instance names, common parameters for selecting a service instance
      (weight or priority) as well as other service-specific parameters. For
      the specific case of autonomic networks, GeneRic Autonomic Signaling
      Protocol (GRASP) intends to be used for service discovery in addition to
      the setup of basic connectivity. Reinventing advanced service discovery
      for GRASP with a similar set of features as DNS-SD would result in
      duplicated work. To avoid that, this document defines how to use GRASP
      to announce and discover services relying upon DNS-SD features while
      maintaining the intended simplicity of GRASP. To that aim, the document
      defines name discovery and schemes for reusable elements in GRASP
      objectives. </t>

    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
      <t>DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) <xref target="RFC6763"></xref> defines
      a framework for applications to announce and discover services. This
      includes service names, service instance names, common parameters for
      selecting a service instance (weight, priority) as well as other
      service-specific parameters.</t>

      <t>GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) <xref
      target="RFC8990"></xref> is intended to also be used for service
      discovery purposes. Reinventing service discovery for GRASP with a
      similar set of features would result in duplication of work. Therefore,
      this document defines how to use GRASP to announce and discover services
      in a way that inherits DNS-SD features and also tries to be compatible
      in spirit as much as possible while still maintaining the intended
      simplicity of GRASP.</t>

      <t>The goal of this document is to permit defining service and their
      parameters once and then use that in GRASP, mDNS and (unicast) DNS.
      Future work can also define DNS-SD &lt;-&gt; GRASP gateway
      functions.</t>

      <t>This document primarily defines how to perform service discovery
      across such a GRASP domain leveraging GRASP's options to perform
      unsolicited flooding of announcements or flooding of requests, and
      finding the closest service instances. Also, the document allows for
      automatically discovering DNS-SD servers. Such features is meant to
      optimize the flooding traffic in some deployments. </t>

      <t>The initial use case of this document is to support what in DNS-SD is
      done via mDNS but in larger networks - GRASP-Domains. Beside the
      efficient flooding, GRASP provides reliability and security, which are
      depending on the so called substrate used by GRASP for security and
      hop-by-hop/end-to-end transport, such as the Autonomic control
      plane (ACP), <xref target="RFC8994"/>. Providing compatibility with existing mDNS service
      announcer or clients is possible, but not described in this version of
      the document.</t>

      <t>The encoding of information chosen in this document does not try to
      use GRASP solely as a transport layer, but to also leverage the CBOR
      structure of GRASP messages to natively encode the message elements
      required for services in a way that is most simple - instead of using
      GRASP only as, e.g., an encapsulation of otherwise unchanged DNS message
      encodings. This is done to minimize the amount of coding required (and
      not require any DNS code unless future gateway functions are required),
      to increase the simplicity, minimize the amount of data on the wire, and
      allow easier extensibility. On the downside, the mechanisms provided
      here do not cover the whole slew of possible options of DNS/DNS-SD, but
      instead only those deemed to be required. Others can be added later.</t>

      <t>In support of service discovery, this document also defines name
      discovery and schemes for reusable elements in GRASP objectives which
      are designed to be extensible so that future work that identifies
      elements required across multiple objectives do not need to define a
      scheme how to do this.</t>

    <section anchor="normative" title="Specification">
      <section anchor="service-objectives" title="Service and Name Objectives">
        <t>Unsolicited, flooded announcements (M_FLOOD) in GRASP and solicited
        flooded discovery (M_DISCOVERY) operate on the unit of GRASP technical
        objectives (identified by 'objective-names' as discussed in Section
        2.10 of <xref target="RFC8990"></xref>). Therefore, a scheme is
        required to indicate services via 'objective-names'. </t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>Note: Future work may want to reuse the encodings related to
            services (defined below in this document) inside other (multicast
            or unicast only) objective exchanges, in which case the service
            names are not impacted.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>When a technical objective (simply referred to as objective) is
        meant to be solely about a service name, the objective MUST uses an
        'objective-name' of 'SRV.&lt;service-name&gt;'. This naming scheme is
        meant to avoid creating duplicates and, potentially, inconsistent name
        registrations for those objectives vs. registrations done, for
        example, for DNS-SD. </t>

        <t>When an objective is meant announcement and discovery of a DNS
        compatible &lt;name&gt; such as "www-internal" in
        "www-internal.example.com", the objective SHOULD use an objective-name
        of NAME.&lt;name&gt;. See <xref target="name-resolution"></xref> for
        more details.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="elements-structure"
               title="Objective Value Reuseable Elements Structure">
        <t>Because service discovery, as explained in the prior section, needs
        to utilize different objectives, it requires cross-objective
        standardized encoding of the elements of services. GRASP does not
        define standardized message elements for the message body (called
        "objective-value") of GRASP messages. Therefore, this document
        introduces such a feature.</t>

        <t><figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[         
objective-value  /= { 1*elements }
elements        //= ( @rfcXXXX: { 1*relement } )

relement  = ( relement-codepoint => relement-value )
relement-codepoint = uint
relement-value     = any

]]></artwork>
          </figure></t>

        <t>If an objective relies upon reusable elements, the
        'objective-value' MUST be a CBOR map and the reusable elements are
        found under the key "@rfcXXXX". </t>

        <t>Objectives that do not want reusable elements may use any
        objective-value format including a CBOR map, but they can not use the
        "@rfcXXXX" key if they use a map. This approach was chosen as the
        hopefully least intrusive mechanism given how by nature all of
        "objective-value" is meant to be defined by individual objective
        definitions.</t>

        <t>The value of "@rfcXXXX" is a map of reusable elements. Each
        'relement' has an IANA registered element-name and codepoint (see
        <xref target="iana-considerations"></xref>). The element-name is for
        documentation purposes only, CBOR encodings only use the numeric
        codepoint for encoding efficiency to minimize the risk for this
        solution to not be applicable to low-bitrate networks such as in
        IoT.</t>

        <t>Format and semantic of the relement-value is determined by the
        specification of the reusable element as is the fact whether more than
        one instances of the same reusable element are permitted.</t>

        <t>Reusable elements should be defined to be extensible. The methods
        used depend on the complexity of the element and the likely need to
        extend/modify the element with backward or non-backward compatible
        information. The following is a set of initial options to choose
        from:</t>

        <t>Element values that are a map MUST permit and reserve key value 0
        (numerical) for private extensions of the element defined by the
        individual objective.</t>

        <t>Element values that are a map MUST NOT use bareword key values
        starting with a "_". These too are for private extensions defined by
        the individual objective.</t>

        <t>Element values SHOULD be defined so that additional keys in maps
        and additional elements at the end of arrays can be ignored by prior
        versions of the definition. Whenever a newer definition is made for an
        element where this rule is violated, the element SHOULD be changed in
        a way for older version recipients to recognize that it is not
        compatible with it.</t>

        <t>One method to indicate compatibility is a traditional version
        "&lt;mayor&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;". Within the same &lt;mayor&gt; version
        number, increasing &lt;minor&gt; version numbers must be backward
        compatible. Different &lt;mayor&gt; version numbers are not expected
        to be compatible with each other. If they are, then this can be
        indicated by including multiple version numbers.</t>

        <t>A compressed form of version compatibility information is the use
        of a simple bitmask element where each bit indicates a version that
        the represented data is compatible with.</t>

          <t>Sender-loop-count is set by the sender of an objective message to
          the same value as the loop-count of the message. On receipt,
          distance = ( sender-loop-count - loop-count ) is the distance of the
          sender from the receiver in hops. This element can be used for
          informational purposes in M_FLOOD and M_DISCOVERY messages and may
          be required to be used in these messages by the specification of
          other elements (such as the service element described below). This
          element MUST occur at most once. If a receiver expects to use the
          distance but sender-loop-count was not announced, then distance
          SHOULD be assumed to be 255 by the receiver.</t>

              It is used in the same way as "Describe-request" except that

          <t>The NAME,&lt;name&gt; elements is meant to provide basic name
          resolution comparable to mDNS name resolution for GRASP domains
          where this is desirable and no better name resolution exist - for
          example in the ACP where there is no requirement for DNS.</t>

          <t>Because the GRASP service lookup (unlike) DNS does not mandate
          that nodes have names (not even service instance names), the use of
          names is primarily meant to support legacy software. New designs
          should instead look up only services and service instance names, and
          nodes should announce their names as service instance names for the
          services they offer:</t>

          <t>For example consider a GRASP (ACP) domain of "example.com". The
          node providing some "www" service could have a name "www-internal"
          which means GRASP objective NAME.www-internal, that objective value
          would include primarily the nodes IP address(es) and the port number
          for the www service would have to be guessed (80). Better, the node
          would announce GRASP objective SRV.www and the objective value would
          include the service instance name www-internal and the (TCP) port
          information (80 or a non-default port).</t>

          <t>Name information is carried in the name-element relement. It is a

          adds the name component and that it does not permit the service and
          instance components and that it allows only describe and
          describe-request values in the msg-type. Clocators MUST use the
          ipv6-address-option or ipv4-address-option in the locator-option
          component.</t>

          <t>TBD: Unclear if/how we should best formalize the differences in
          the context element permitted information between services and
          names. The above is quite informal.</t>

          <t>Priority, weight, kvpairs, range (and of course private) MAY be

          <t>Nodes may have multiple names. These can be listed in the name
          component. If a nodes names have the notion of a primary name and
          secondary names then the primary name should be the first in the
          list of names. In DNS-SD, the name pointed to by CNAME RRs can be
          considered to be the primary name. A describe-request for a
          non-primary name SHOULD return in the list of names the requested
          name and the primary name.</t>

      <section anchor="usage" title="Using GRASP Service Announcements">
        <t>TBD: This section contains a range of details that should become
        normative in later versions.</t>

        <t>This section provides a step by step walk-through of how to use
        GRASP service announcements and compares it to DNS-SD.</t>

        <t>The most simple method to use GRASP service discovery is to select
        (and if still necessary, register) a &lt;service-name&gt; and start
        one or more agents (e.g.: ASAs) announcing their service instance(s)
        via GRASP. At minimum, an agent should periodically (default 60
        seconds) announce the service instance via GRASP M_FLOOD messages as
        an objective SRV.&lt;service-name&gt; with a srv-element and a
        sender-loop-count element (default 255). The ttl of the GRASP message
        should be 3.5 times the announcement period, e.g.: 210000 msec.</t>

        <t>Consumers of the service will use GRASP to learn of the service
        instances and select one. This approach is most similar to the use of
        DNS-SD with mDNS except that the scope of the announcement is a whole
        GRASP domain (such as the ACP) as opposed to a single IP subnet in
        mDNS and that mDNS primarily relies on request &amp; reply but in its
        standard not on periodic unsolicited announcements. We describe here
        the unsolicited flooding option via M_FLOOD first because it is
        recommended for services with a dense population of service consumers
        and it is most simple to describe.</t>

        <t>On the service announcer, the parameters priority, weight and range
        of the service instance can be selected from intent or configuration -
        or left at default. The default range 255 will result in selection of
        a random target of the service like in DNS-SD. Setting priority/weight
        allows to prioritize and weigh the selection as in DNS-SD. Setting
        range to 0 allows to select the closest target, priority/weight are
        only compared between targets of the same shortest distance. Distance
        based options are not available in DNS-SD because it does not expect
        that network distance is available to arbitrary DNS-SD client. It is
        available to GRASP clients though. Using 0 &lt; range &lt; 255 allows
        for a hybrid priority/weight and distance based service selection
        (e.g.: Select the highest priority instance within a range of 5
        hops).</t>

        <t>If the service is a non-GRASP service, then the result of the
        service discovery has to be a transport locator to which the client
        can open a connection and talk the protocol implied by the service.
        This transport locator(s) have to be put into the clocator parameter.
        The context of the clocator would normally be "", aka: the transport
        locator is in the IP reachability associated with the GRASP domain
        (e.g.: IPv6 of the ACP for ACP GRASP domain).</t>

        <t>If an ACP service is announced via ACP GRASP, then the locator(s)
        can be O_IPv6_LOCATOR or O_FQDN_LOCATOR. The O_IPv6_LOCATOR is used if
        the service is defined to be available via some transport layer port
        (TCP, UDP or other). The determination of the actual transport
        connection to be used is the same as in DNS-SD: If the transport
        protocol is not TCP or UDP, it has to be implied by the specification
        of &lt;service-name&gt; or can be detailed in kvpairs which carries
        the same information as DNS-TXT TXT RRs of the service. Alternatively,
        the transport-proto field of the locator can contain any valid IP
        protocol directly (TBD), which is not possible in DNS-SD.</t>

        <t>Like DNS-SD, service discovery via GRASP does not require
        allocation and use of well-known ports for services. Unlike DNS-SD,
        there is no need in GRASP to define service instance names or target
        names. In DNS SD, PTR RRs resolve from a service name to a set of
        service instance named. SRV and TXT RRs resolve from service instance
        names to service instance parameters including the target. A target is
        the DNS host name of the service instance. It gets resolved via A/AAAA
        RRs to IPv4/IPv6 addresses of the target. In GRASP service discovery,
        host names are not used. Service instance names are optional too.
        Service instance names are useful for human diagnostics and human
        selection of service instances. In fully automated environments, they
        can be are less important. For diagnostic purposes, it is recommended
        to give service instances service instance names in GRASP service
        announcements.</t>

        <t>A locator with O_URI_LOCATOR type can be used in GRASP to indicate
        a URI for the transport method for a service instance. If the URI
        includes a host part, care must be taken to use only IP addresses in
        the host part if the context of the GRASP domain does not support host
        name resolution - such as the ACP - or to use the GRASP name
        resolution mechanisms described elsewhere in this document. And that
        the addresses indicated are also reachable in the GRASP domain. For
        example, in service announcements across a DULL GRASP domain, only the
        IPv6 link-local addresses on that subnet must be used (this applies
        equally when using the O_IPv6_LOCATOR).</t>

        <t>Instead of using M_FLOOD to periodically announce service
        instances, M_DISCOVERY can be used to actively query for service
        instances. The msg-type type must then be "describe-request". Because
        no periodic flooding is necessary, this solution is more lightweight
        for the network when the number of requesting clients is small. Note
        though that the M_DISCOVERY will terminate as soon as a provider of
        the objective is found, so the service instances found will be based
        on distance and therefore selection of instance by priority and weight
        will not work equally well as with M_FLOOD. Consider for example a
        central service instance in the NOC that should always be used (for
        example for centralized operational diagnostics) unless the WAN
        connection is broken, in which case distributed backup service
        instances should be used. With the current logic of M_DISCOVERY this
        is not possible.</t>

               title="Further Comparison with DNS-SD">
        <t>Neither the GRASP SRV.* objective-name, the service name nor any
        other parameter explicitly indicate the second label "_tcp" or "_udp"
        of DNS-SD entries. DNS-SD, RFC6763 explains how this is an
        unnecessary, historic artifact.</t>

        <t>This version of the document does not define an equivalent to
        "_sub" structuring of service enumeration.</t>

        <t>This version of the document does not define mechanisms for reverse
        resolution of arbitrary services: An inquirer may unicast M_SYNC_REC
        to a node with a series of objectives with specific service names of
        interest and describe-request, but there is no indication of "ANY"
        service.</t>

      <section anchor="open-issues" title="Open Issues">
        <t>TBD: Examine limitations mentioned in "in this version of the
        text/document".</t>

        <t>TBD: The GRASP specification does currently only permit TCP and UDP
        for the transport-proto element. This draft should expand the GRASP
        definitions to permit any valid IP protocol. We just need to decide
        whether this should only apply to the locator in the srv element or
        also retroactive to the locator-option in GRASP messages (maybe not
        there ?).</t>

        <t>TBD: A fitting CBOR representation for a kvpair key without value
        needs to be specified so that it can be distinguished from an empty
        value as outlined in RFC6763 section 6.4.</t>

        <t>TBD: In this version, every service/service-instance is an element
        by itself. Future versions of this document may add more encoding
        options to allow more compact encoding of recurring fields.</t>

        <t>TBD: Is there a way in CDDL to formally define the string names of
        the relement-codepoint's ?</t>

    <section anchor="iana-considerations" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document requests IANA to create a new "GRASP Objective Value
      Standard Elements" subregistry under the "GeneRic Autonomic Signaling
      Protocol (GRASP) Parameters" registry. </t>

      <t>The values in this table are names and a unique numerical value
      assigned to each name. Future values MUST be assigned using the RFC
      Required policy as dedfined in Section 4.7 of <xref
      target="RFC8126"></xref>. The numerical value is simply to be assigned
      sequentially. The following initial values are assigned by this
      document:</t>

      <t>sender-loop-count 1 [defined in rfcXXXX]</t>

      <t>srv-element 2 [defined in rfcXXXX]</t>

      <t>name-element 3 [defined in rfcXXXX]</t>

      <t>This document updates the handling of the "GRASP Objective Names"
      Table introduced in the GRASP IANA considerations as follows:</t>

      <t>Assignments for objective-names of the form "SRV.&lt;text&gt;" and
      "NAME.&lt;text&gt;" are special.</t>

      <t>Assignment of "SRV.&lt;text&gt;" can only be requested if
      &lt;text&gt; is also a registered service-name according to RFC6335. The
      specification required for registration of a "GRASP Objective Name" MUST
      declare that the intended use of the objective name in GRASP is intended
      to be compatible with the indented use of the registered service
      name.</t>

      <t>Registration of "SRV.&lt;text&gt;" in the "GRASP Objective Name"
      table is optional, but recommended for all new service-names that are
      meant to be used with GRASP. Non-registration can for example happen
      with DNS-SD &lt;-&gt; GRASP gateways that inject pre-existing
      service-names into GRASP. Note that according to the GRASP RFC,
      registration is mandatory, so this exemption for "SRV.&lt;text&gt;" is
      also an update to that specification.</t>

      <t>There MUST NOT be any assignment for objective names of the form
      "NAME.&lt;text&gt;". These names are simply used by GRASP nodes without
      registration (just like names in mDNS).</t>
